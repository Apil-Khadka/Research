Bridging the Gap to the Future: Designing Smart Relays for Home Automation
Home automation is rapidly transforming from a futuristic concept to an everyday reality. This project focuses on designing smart relays to modernize and automate the control of home and building switches. By integrating advanced technologies, these smart relays aim to seamlessly "smartify" traditional systems, paving the way for enhanced convenience, efficiency, and automation in living spaces.}
